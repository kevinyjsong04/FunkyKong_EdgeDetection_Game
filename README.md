# Interactive_Art_with_AI

## Inspiration
With the expansive abilities many CS areas are able to accomplish, we were inspired to explore the creative medium of CS as there is often a lack of knowledge or awareness of this niche sector. We wanted the users to be able to express themselves freely online through our filters with our program; thus, the AI Interactive Program was the perfect idea for this.

## What it does
We take the user's camera input and apply convolutions to the image to perform edge detection. We display all the highlighted edges on the screen. Additionally, there is a light source that draws rays on the screen. Finally, we created a few demo scenes, while playing around with the processing.

## How we built it
We primary used Java and the Java Processing Library in this project.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge that we ran into was implementing the ray tracing and edge detection algorithms for our program. Both algorithms were extremely math and algorithmically heavy and it was often hard to visualize or debug small mistakes due to how abstract some parts were. However, we were able to ask each other for help, working together to solve these semantic questions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of all the work and the final product that we were able to accomplish in this limited time at HackGT. Even though we faced many coding challenges, we were able to persevere at the end and push each other to the end. Without each other, we would definitely not be where we are today!

## What we learned
We learned the importance of creating a solid plan before jumping into the coding part of projects. Our group initially lacked a conclusive plan for our project, oftentimes going with the flow. This eventually wasted a lot of time as we were met with nonworkable algorithms and led to some miscommunication on what part each person was assigned to do.

## What's next for AI Interactive Art
We are planning to deploy our program to a front-end website to broaden our audience scope and allow the program to be accessible to everyone online. Furthermore, we will be excited to add more features and filters to our program to increase the ability for users to experiment and express themselves with our AI Interactive Art program.
